# Deep Learning Architecture Patterns

Deep learning architectures come in many shapes and sizes. Here are some common patterns you'll encounter:

## 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are the go-to architecture for image-related tasks. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

## 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs, including LSTM and GRU variants, are designed to work with sequential data like time series or natural language.

## 3. Transformer Architecture

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing tasks with their attention mechanism, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input.

Understanding these patterns will help you choose the right architecture for your specific problem.
